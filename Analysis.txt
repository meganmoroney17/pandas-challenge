3 observable trends based on this data
1. As already stated, there are significantly more male players (84%) vs female players (14%), however, it is something to note that females tend to spend on average $0.40 more per person than males do.
2. As obvious as it may seem, I think it’s worth noting that the top 2 most popular items are also the most profitable. They have a high item price, although not the highest item price. The amount of purchases helps make them most profitable.
3. The target age demographic as well as the secondary groups are spot on. I do want to add that it might be worth looking into targeting older groups after 25-29 only because it seems that those groups spend a lot per person and have a higher purchase price, specifically 36-39, but 30-34 is similar. Could make a difference in profit.
